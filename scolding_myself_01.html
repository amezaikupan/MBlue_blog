<h1>Self-Reflection</h1>

<p>From the last year, I have started to learn a lot. Ways to deal with things. The biggest is myself.</p>

<p>I'm quite a critical person with myself. That's one way to say it, but to be honest, I think it's because I don't know how else to deal with myself, especially when I make a mistake. To scold myself, that is the only way I know how to deal with things. That is what happens to me when I make a mistake around people too.</p>

<p>But I didn't like just that. I don't want to just <em>feel bad</em> when I do things wrong. I want something different. Something different than just <strong>feeling bad</strong>, <strong>making myself feel worse</strong>, <strong>drown in that</strong>, and <strong>comes the self-pity</strong>, and the cycle repeat because I don't get to feel pity for myself. I did wrong, you know.</p>

<p>90% of me just hated feeling bad. 10% left is that I'm so fed up with this 1 way things work. (Its a boring story. Change is scary but looks like not changing is even more scary).</p>

<p>Recently, I feel like my effort to accept myself and change things - <strong>very</strong> little by little - paying off.</p>

<hr>

<h3>How things used to be:</h3>

<ul>
    <li>I did thing wrong</li>
    <li>People get mad</li>
    <li>I beat myself up</li>
    <li>Drown in guilt and not letting myself relief because I don't deserve it</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h3>How things are now:</h3>

<ul>
    <li>I did thing wrong</li>
    <li>People get mad</li>
    <li>I split into 2 modes: I beat myself up (so that I know that I did it wrong), but I also accept that 
        <ul>
            <li>I will mess things up</li>
            <li>I have things that can be considered "bad"</li>
            <li>I want to change but it will take time</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>So I can be forgiving to myself and not make myself down in guilt anymore</li>
</ul>

<p>I most difficult thing probably to feel that you "can trust yourself". It's strange, but it something that you have to experience. It's had been difficult for me to accept myself, like I can be bad at these things, and not good at these things, many things I myself hate. But that's okay. It takes a lot of trust when you are in the situation that you hated yourself, to step up and say, I accept you like this, even though you look like the person I hate the most in the world right now, even if you look like the person who I don't want to become the most in the world right now, I believe in you.</p>

<p>It was a shitty journey (it hurts and but I'm glad I pulled my gut to go meet a school therapist. She is old school but it means I'm working on myself. And I got started with meditating on the Headspace app with Answer in Progress 60 days trial).</p>

<p>Anyway, you won't know what kind of person I am when I am at my worst just by reading. Not like I try or even want to show people what I am like, but I think it'll help some people to know that someone out there in the world who is all these can find a way to be kind to themselves, then maybe you can too.</p>

<ul>
    <li>I look down on a lot of things, a lot of people, even though I know I'm not better than any of them. I can say I am a bit narcissistic. I myself really hate people who look down on things, but I look down on the mainstream, on dentists because I think they have boring lives, on people who don't try to fix their life. I look down on school and business people because I think they are shallow. I am full of biases like that. But I trust myself that I want to be proven wrong. I know I will hurt people in the process, but I won't hurt anyone on purpose, and I know I will choose to be hurt than to be right. I trust that I will want to learn.</li>
    <li>I can be disrespectful. I know I don't recognize the effort of many people, those that I don't see. My teacher, my parents, friend, and sibling.</li>
    <li>I can be single-minded.</li>
    <li>I can be embarrassing to be with. I don't know how to dress well, talk well or even want to socialize. Many times I don't want to talk or listen to people.</li>
</ul>

<p>... but I'm glad I try to love myself too. The way I try to love people and the sky, the flower, the air, my PC, the toilet, the bee, silent, sadness... listen.</p>
